# Guidelines for Commentators and Streamers

## Commentators
- Be respectful. We tolerate no racism, sexism, or any form of exclusion or derogatory manners to any player, viewer or human
- Commentate on what you see, and provide any unique insight you have. Everyone can see what is happening, but not everyone knows what you take from that.
- Feel free to analyse players/teams, but don’t just focus on what they need to improve on, make sure to say something they did well. If they did nothing good, don’t say anything.
- Feel free to interact with the chat, have fun, but not during a game.

## Streamers

### Before commencing the stream
- Turn friend notifications to none so that there are no friend notification during matches
- Turn motion controls off in Splatoon’s settings (unless you will always be doing auto-spec)

Each match, decide whether you want to do auto spec or manual spec. Whatever you decide, it must be decided at the start of the match and can not be interchanged during a match. Since you’ll most likely be commentating we recommend using the auto spec so you can focus on the action.

### Using auto spec
- Select auto spec in the lobby and push the ready immediately
- At the start of the match, open up the map to show weapon combos until the auto camera goes towards a player

### Doing manual spec
- Make sure auto spec isn’t enabled in the lobby
- Open the map to show map weapon combos for a few seconds
- From the full stage view, go to a player first, not the objective
- Whenever a player dies, switch the camera to the player that splattered them
- In the case where it was a trade or the player who you would be switching to died, either switch to a player within the camera or the objective (if it’s nearby).
- If you’re viewing the objective, don’t keep the camera still, give it a slight pan
- Never switch to a player that isn't within the view of the camera 
- Don’t switch between more than one player at a time, this creates a sense of chaos and doesn’t look good. Unless a player dies, wait 5 seconds before switching the camera to another player. If you do accidentally go to the wrong player, don’t try and fix it, just stick with it and move on. If there's been a trade, or you switch to a player who has already been splattered, switch to either the objective or full map overhead view.
