## General
#### What is my 'Signal Strength'?
Consider it your experience within Off the Dial. You earn points for every tournament you play in as well as how well you place in the tournament. There are bonus roles for those who strive to earn as much signal strength as they can, good luck!

#### Why is my 'Signal Strength' is lower than last time I checked?
Every now and then we revise our systems and often this may result in your signal strength unfortunately being reset. The last time this was reset was at the end of 2020.

#### What time do tournaments begin?
All tournaments begin on the same minute/hour, but due to timezones that time may differ. Daylight savings times have been listed as well.

Refer to your corresponding time-zone.

- `EST` 3pm Saturday
- `EDT` 4pm Saturday
- `GMT` 8pm Saturday
- `BST` 9pm Saturday
- `JST` 5am Sunday
- `AEST` 6am Sunday
- `AEDT` 7am Sunday

#### What time do tournaments end?
Tournaments usually last anywhere between 2 and 5 hours (generally around the four hour mark)

#### Will tournaments be streamed?
Yes! If there are at-least 4 teams, 1 match from each preliminary round will be streamed. There will be a five-minute break before the first finals match. All finals matches will be streamed as well.

#### How are disputes/issues resolved?
If you have any problems before the tournament, <Mention>#helpdesk</Mention> is the place to go. If you've registered, there's also a <Mention>#tourney-helpdesk</Mention>. During the tournament, we would prefer if you used the smash.gg chat and called for a moderator to assist, however we will be still monitoring the helpdesk channels.

#### How are teams balanced?
Teams are calculated based on your ranks, play style and previous competitive experience. All of these are converted into numerical values and then teams are created into drafts using code, and then balanced using human balancing.

#### What is Swiss?
Swiss is a bracket format, like Single Elimination or Round Robin. However, there are some things that set Swiss apart from other systems. First of all, it's non-eliminating, meaning you play the same amount of rounds regardless of if you lose or not. Swiss pairs you up with people that are closest to the same win/loss record as you, making sure all rounds are as balanced as possible.

#### Am I able to scrim other teams competing in the tournament?
Yes! We have no issue with you setting up a scrim with other competitors.

#### Why organization spelled with an 's'?
While this is an international server, the owner is Australian. So you may see many words are spelled differently outside of the United States, namely 'organisation'.

#### I need to contact someone, how should I do it?

There are many ways to contact us. If you need help and it's not in here ask in <Mention>#helpdesk</Mention> and any of the <Mention>@Staff<Mention> will help you or someone who knows the answer will help. If it requires one of the organisers feel free to ping either of us or the <Mention>@Organiser</Mention> role (please only do so when needed). You can also DM us on discord. If you want to do it off Discord we regularly check the [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Off_The_Dial) so you can find us there. While on Twitter feel free to use the hashtags [#otd-idtga](https://twitter.com/search?q=(%23idtga)) and [#otd-wl](https://twitter.com/search?q=(%23otd-wl)) and mention [@Off_The_Dial](https://twitter.com/Off_the_Dial) or [@DJam987](https://twitter.com/DJam987).

#### I need help using smash.gg, where can I get it?

#### I've got a question, where do I ask?

<Mention>#helpdesk</Mention> is the best place to go.

## It’s Dangerous to go Alone

#### What is It’s Dangerous to go Alone?

It’s Dangerous to go Alone is a tournament that sorts free agents into teams, and then those teams play each other until one is crowned victory! Teams are balanced based on a players ranks, play style and tournament experience.

#### What does IDTGA stand for?

IDTGA is our way of shortening It’s Dangerous to go Alone.

#### Is there a skill limit/cap?

No, we understand that if you don't have a team and want to experience a tournament you are not likely to be an X rank. Therefore we have no skill limit. Any player from C- to X can play in IDTGA.

#### Can I still play if I'm already on a team?

Even if you're already on a team you and your teammates can still play, just don't expect to be on the same team.

#### When do we receive our teams?

Teams are released 48 hours before the tournament commences.

#### Why is check-in so early?

This is so we can confirm you are playing before we sort players into teams. It is a way we minimise dropouts.

#### I'm on the list of 'Invalid Attendees - Only on smash.gg'. How can I fix this?

This is a list of smash.gg tags that have signed up on the smash.gg tournament page, but could not be traced back to any signup on otd.ink. If you're on this list, you will be removed from the tournament due to your signup being invalid, so it's important that you fix this.

The most common reason is that players will have signed up on the smash.gg page, however, they will fail to return back to [otd.ink](https://otd.ink) to complete the signup process. If you see that you do not have the "Signed Up!" role on discord, make sure you return back to the signup page to complete the signup, just scroll past the smash.gg section as you have completed that step already.

Another common reason is signing up with a different smash.gg account than the one that you have linked on your otd.ink profile. Make sure that the smash.gg user slug that you set on otd.ink points to the correct account, and that the account's smash.gg tag matches your smash.gg tag that is listed under invalid attendees.

#### Why is there also check-in for each match on smash.gg?

This is a setting that comes default with smash.gg and there is no way to disable it, so make sure you check in for every match you play!

#### I’ve just finished a season of IDTGA, what do I do now?

If you’re playing in Swiss, make sure that all your rounds are completed. If you didn’t make the finals feel free to watch the rest of the stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/offthedial). Shortly after the tournament finishes, a feedback forum will be released. We would appreciate it if you gave honest feedback that can improve the next season.

## Weakest Link

#### What is Weakest Link?

Weakest link is a unique, Off the Dial exclusive, tournament featuring both teams and free agents! Sign up as a 3 player team and get paired up with a lone FA.

#### Is there a skill limit/cap?

There is a skill limit for teams, and there is a skill cap for players, if you are a FA above the skill cap, you can create a pickup team, if you are a team below the skill limit, you can sign up as a FA instead.

## Off the Dial Bot

#### What is Off the Dial Bot?

Off the Dial Bot is a custom built bot by LeptoFlare, It provides many commands that help us run tournaments more smoothly. You can find a page regarding the bot [here](bot).

#### Is Off the Dial Bot open-sourced?

Yes! You can find all the code on [Github](https://github.com/LeptoFlare/offthedialbot).

#### I have a suggestion/bug report for Off the Dial Bot.

We'd love it if you made a Github Issue using [this link](https://github.com/LeptoFlare/offthedialbot/issues/new/choose). This lets us track all of the suggestions and reports permanently in one place, as opposed to the suggestions channel, where the messages can get easily lost.
