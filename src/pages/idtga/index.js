        <h2>Registration Details</h2>
        <p>
          Since this is a solo registration event, you sign up alone. The
          tournament organisers will handle assembling teams for you.
        </p>
        <h3>Registering as a sub</h3>
        <p>
          If you missed the registration deadline, you can still sign up as a
          sub by going to the same signup link. We highly recommend doing this if
          you miss the signup date, as many players end up either dropping out
          or needing a sub.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are needed, you will recieve a dm asking whether you are
          available to sub and specific details about what team you will be
          subbing for. Once you agree, you will be given the competing and team
          roles, then you should get in contact with your other team members.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please make sure you have turned on DMs for the server, and try your
          best to avaliable to reply during the tournament.
