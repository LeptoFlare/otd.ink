- If you finish a round early, you must wait for the next round to begin.

## DC's Redo Decision Rules
### Redo the match if:
- The team with the DC stops playing and allows the other team to KO.
- The team with the DC stays inside their spawn barrier.

### Do NOT redo the match if:
- **Any player** on the same team DC's again in the same round.

- The host DC's.
- The match has passed 2:30 before the DC'ing team has forfeited.
- The team without a DC has 50 or less objective remaining (excluding penalty).

### After the DC
- The player who had a DC must rejoin/be ready within 60 seconds of the lobby reopening.
- All players must ready up immediately
- All players must use the same weapons/gear as shown in the results.
- The only exemption to the three rules above are if a substitute is replacing the player who had a DC.
- If either 2 DC’s occur in the same lobby or the host DC’s, the team currently not hosting must host a new lobby.
> *Note: To reduce the chances of a dc happening, please check you have a good internet connection with low ping and/or have a LAN adapter for a smoother experience. If not, consider switching hosts.*

### Lag Complaints
- If there's are complaints about lag from at least 3 people on the same team or 1 person from each team, teams are required to switch hosts to someone on the opposing team.

## Reporting players
Sometimes, your team needs a replacement for one of your team members. Some examples may include:
- A team member notifies you that something has come up and they need to drop out.
- A team member just isn't responding at all to any messages.
- A team member is acting really toxic to the rest of your team.
- A team member is making one or more of your other team members uncomfortable.

Thankfully, Off the Dial has an extensive system for reporting such players and receiving a sub, so you can be sure you'll have a good team experience.

- Your team is able to report players 24 hours after teams are released.
- Everyone on your team (besides the player getting reported) must approve of the report.
- Your sub is not allowed to play for any other player on your team except for the reported player they are replacing.
- Once your sub is assigned, the reported player is no longer allowed to play.
- **This is an irreversible action**, so be thoughtful when you report!

### How to report
To report a player, send a message in the <Mention>#reporting</Mention> channel, formatted like this:
> <Mention>@ReportedPlayer</Mention> - Reason for reporting

If you don't feel comfortable reporting them publicly, you can send any staff member a DM instead :blue_heart:.

- Please ping the person that you are reporting, don't just give their username.
- For better chances of approval, make sure your reason is specific and detailed. Such as:
  > "Despite their status being set to online, they haven't responded to any of our DMs since teams have been created, multiple of our team members have attempted to get in contact with them, but to no avail".

Once you have made your report, our staff members will update you with the status of your report by reacting to your report message:
- :spiral_note_pad: - We've noted your report, and are working on matching a sub. This step usually takes 6-12 hours.
- :white_check_mark: - The report has been resolved, we have assigned a sub.
- :no_entry_sign: - We don't approve of the report. This usually doesn't happen, assuming you did everything correctly.

If there is no reaction, we haven't seen your report yet.

### Receiving your sub
Once you've been assigned your sub, you should see a reply to your original report, usually formatted like this:
> <Mention>@Sub</Mention> > <Mention>@ReportedPlayer</Mention>

You now know your sub. Friend them on discord, add them to your group chat, and hopefully get some practice in!

## Cheating
Forms of cheating include, but are not limited to, playing under false names, bracket manipulation, any form or variation of machine/bot assisted button mashing (known as "turbo mode", or similar names), providing false information in your profile or on smash.gg, anything considered cheating by Nintendo, and failure to comply with any of the rules on this document.

If you cheat:

- Instant disqualification from the tournament.
- A permanent ban from Off the Dial and all tournaments.

This is a strict no-chances policy, and we do not make exceptions to this.

## Others
- All rules are subject to change between seasons, please make sure you read the rules each season before entering.
- By registering you agree to abide by our [terms and conditions](/legal).
