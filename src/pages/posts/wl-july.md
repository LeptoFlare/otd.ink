## Patch Notes
- We're now a Signatory of [Splatoon Safety](https://twitter.com/splatsafety). This means we'll be following a generalised code of conduct for any tournament that we manage. If you're on the banned list of this code you will not be able to play in any __Off the Dial__ tournament for the duration of your ban. You can see the full Code on Conduct [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pf6S25d2rFDAP5JUJzaVeEkb0OGYIaGo-LQ3KGXUOpA/edit?usp=sharing). We wish to protect the community of Splatoon, so if you have experienced anything that could be considered as an offence in this code, please let an organiser know or [send an email](splatsafety@gmail.com)
- We've updated how we distribute Signal Strength. If you've played as an emergency substitute as a part of a team, you will receive a small increment of points. If you missed rounds because you dropped out or unexpectedly disappeared, points will be deducted from the total amount earned from that season.

Stay tuned!
