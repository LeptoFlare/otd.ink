## Welcome to the Story Mode

Oh, where to begin. The Off the Dial Story Mode in an ARG, story-based, FA tournament. Its full name is an alternative reality game that is a story based free agent tournament. Better? No... 

## The Actual Tournament
But don't fret! The story is __not needed__ to play in the tournament. The actual tournament itself is a **free agent tournament** that is identical to a regular season of **It's Dangerous to go Alone** (read more on IDTGA [here](https://otd.ink/idtga)). This is how the tournament schedule will follow:

- Start of August: Registration Opens
- 3 Days Before Tournament: Check-In Opens
- **2 Days Before Tournament: Check-In and Registration Closes**
- 1 Day Before Tournament: Teams are Released
- 10 Minutes Before Tournament: Stream Begins
- Tournament Time: The Tournament Begins

**Can I play?** Yes! You don't need to know a single thing about the story mode to play in this tournament. All you need to know is that this is __free agent tournament for all skill levels__. No skill caps or floors, no region locking, open to anyone.

## Tournament Date
- EDT - Saturday the 29th of August, 4pm
- GMT - Saturday the 29th of August, 8pm
- BST - Saturday the 29th of August, 9pm
- JST - Sunday the 30th of August, 5am
- AEST - Sunday the 30th of August, 6am

## The Story
You might of noticed the [countdown](https://otd.ink/countdown) that has begun ticking down. This is the countdown until when we start releasing lore for this chapter of the story mode. In previous chapters, we've had a lot of time, but not much lore that was released. This time, we're containing the lore within two weeks. So that [countdown](https://otd.ink/countdown) is how long until the first clue is revealed. This is also why there's no title for the story mode yet, because that's part of the story, and will be revealed when that timer hits zero.

In terms of those two weeks, here's how it'll work:
- When the timer hits zero, a video will be either premiered or streamed live, which will announce the title of this chapter, but will also show off the introduction to the story of this chapter. There will be no hidden clues in this video.
- After this, and before the start of the tournament, there will be three clues that will be slowly revealed, each revealing some more of the story.
- These three clues will not only have story information, but will include one piece of the major clue hunt. Each of the three clues will have one of these pieces.
- The three major clues will together piece together one final piece of story. This will be the final hidden clue to the storyline.
- At the end of the tournament, the results that end this book of the story mode will be revealed.

**Good luck players,**
**Stay tuned!**
